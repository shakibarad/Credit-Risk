# Credit-Risk
The purpose of the exercise is to identify the extent of credit risk migration (change in risk 
profile of the portfolio) between the two periods (Period1 and Period2). The candidate has a 
number of alternatives for defining the migration impact and should provide not only a result 
in terms of risk-weight (RWA/EAD), probability of default and expected loss, but also consider 
the impact of new and existing customers and describe the impact of defaulted and unrated 
customers and whether they are relevant to the analysis by considering the effects on PD, 
RWA and EL. Which customers have increased/decreased capital consumption the most? Is 
the rating and PD value consistent?
